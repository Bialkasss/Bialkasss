## 🚀 About Me
I'm an ambitious Artificial Intelligence student with a strong foundation in IT, data analysis, machine learning and deep learning. Recently I became more interested in AI explainability, as I believe it can help general public trust AI processes more. I am the most interested in Computer Vision tasks.
